### Hi, I am Joao 👋

After receiving my first Game Boy and first touching a computer (to draw forms on Paint), in 1998, I have been a firm believer that technology can make our world more human, fun, inclusive and efficient. 🌍

After moving to the UK to work as a nurse, in 2016, and being a force for good, whilst doing my absolute best to improve every single life I touched, being those of patients, their families or my colleagues. 👨‍⚕️ 

I sat and listened, with some degree of scepticism, to a friend as she was telling me that I too could have a more active role in this tech revolution by becoming a Full Stack Developer. 👨‍💻 

Envisioning that my work can come to impact millions and be accessible to everyone through a touch or a click, I am thrilled that I have now completed IronHack Web Development bootcamp and learned so much about Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, Node, REST APIs, MongoDB, Git 😁

My career path demanded that I developed excellent communication and organizational skills. 📅🦜

This led to becoming an easily adaptable professional who is able to deliver high quality results even when under pressure, always without overlooking details. 👀

⚠ Disclaimer:

If I am looking away from a computer, inspire me with stories of your families, friends or dogs, tell me about your country or city of origin or the shōnen manga you have been reading or the anime you have been watching.

If I am still working, please wait.. I really want to hear and know you but your talking is just helping me focus.
