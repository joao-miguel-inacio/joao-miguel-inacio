### Hi, I am Joao 👋

Since 1998, when I received my first Game Boy and first touched a computer (to draw forms on Paint), I believe that tech can make our world more human, fun, inclusive and efficient. 🌍

After moving to the United Kingdom to work as a nurse and be a force for good, I have been doing my best to improve every life I touch. 👨‍⚕️

My career path demanded excellent communication and organizational skills. As a Nurse and Change Nurse, I became someone who can adapt to ever-changing conditions and manage heavy workloads effectively. 📅 🦜

However, despite many achievements in Nursing, as a Full Stack Developer, I dream of being able to reach many more individuals and cause an even more meaningful impact. 👨‍💻

Encouraged by how much I learnt in these last six months about JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, REST APIs, Git, Mongo DB, Express JS, React and Node JS, my heart is set on learning more. 🤓

Grab my attention and inspire me with stories of your family, country or city of origin. If you think I need a break, tell me about the shōnen manga you are reading or the anime you have been watching. 🌸
